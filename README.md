## Installation
To run this project you have to use an instance of Jupyter Notebook with python 3. 
The libraries used for this project are:
* numpy.
* pandas.
* xgboost.
* sklearn.
* scipy.

Note: For the jupyter notebook file "Arvato Project Woorkbook.ipynb" you need to use the CSV provided by Arvato. 

## Project Motivation
My motivation for this project was take a look of the Arvato Customers data, and answer the next questions:
1. What is the segmentation for the customers in Arvato?
2. What is the most important value or values that a customer has to have for be a potential customer?
3. Put in practice all the topics learned in the nanodegree program. 

## File Descriptions
* **Arvato Project Woorkbook.ipynb**
The objective of this Jupyter Notebook is get an idea of how is the data, and what are the important variables to answer our questions. In this file i have used basics functions to know the data, like the _describe_ function and _head_ and you will be watching all the process to get an supervised and a unsupervised model
